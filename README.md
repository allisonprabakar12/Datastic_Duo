🧠 Illinois-Sandia Data Challenge 2024 UIUC x Sandia National Laboratories Datathon Project: Predicting Spanish bilingualism from neural signal data

📌 Overview This project was developed during a three-day datathon hosted in partnership with Sandia National Laboratories. Our team aimed to build a predictive model that estimates a subject’s Spanish language fluency using high-volume brain electrode (neural signal) data.

💡 Objective Design a machine learning model to identify bilingual Spanish speakers by analyzing brain signal patterns and linguistic keyword activity.

🛠️ What We Did Analyzed 10+ raw electrode datasets using data wrangling, keyword identification, and signal filtering techniques

Extracted meaningful features related to language processing

Attempted to prototype a Python-based regression model to estimate fluency levels based on neural patterns

Explored relationships between signal strength, keyword response, and speaker profile data

🧰 Tech Stack Python

Pandas, NumPy for data processing

scikit-learn for regression modeling

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations
